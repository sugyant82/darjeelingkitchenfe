        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p><strong>Welcome to Darjeeling Momo NZ </strong> — your home for authentic Nepalese and Indian flavors right here in South Auckland.</p>

        <p>Our journey began in 2024 when we, a passionate couple from Darjeeling, India, moved to Auckland with a dream to share the beloved tastes of our hometown.
          What started as a humble home-based food business in Manurewa has quickly blossomed into a trusted name for authentic momos and traditional cuisine,
          thanks to the overwhelming love and support from our community.</p>

        <p>We are proud to be officially registered under <strong>Darjeeling Limited</strong> with an active New Zealand Business Number <strong>(NZBN: 9429052191695)</strong> and
          a licensed food operation. Every dish we create is crafted with care, using high-quality ingredients and age-old recipes that have been passed down through generations.
          Our specialty is in offering a variety of handmade momos, each order paired with our signature spice sauce - a true favorite among our customers.</p>

        <p>Customer satisfaction is at the heart of everything we do. Our commitment to delivering fresh, flavorful, and carefully prepared food has been recognized with
          countless 5-star reviews on Facebook Marketplace, a testament to the love and trust we have built within our growing family of food lovers.</p>

        <p>At Darjeeling Momo NZ, every plate tells a story - of heritage, passion, and a shared love for good food. We invite you to join us on this delicious journey and experience
          the authentic flavors of Darjeeling, right here in the heart of South Auckland.</p>

        <p>Thank you for supporting our dream and being a part of our story.</p>
